    "# Week 2–4 Log (Exploration → Direction)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Week 2 – Tools & first exploration\n",
    "- Tools I tried: Chatgpt，Microsoft Copilot\n",
    "- What I asked / tested:I asked the AI to summarise the historical background of MS Euing 26 and MS Gen 13.\n",
    "- What I got:The AI provided a general overview of medieval manuscripts and travel journals.\n",
    "- Quick fact-check:After reviewing the collection website of the University of Glasgow, I found that the AI's account was a bit too general in some details and did not match the actual archival items.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Week 3 – Small experiment\n",
    "- What I generated (text/image/audio):During my visit to the Archives and Special Collections (ASC) facility, I carefully observed these physical items and made detailed records of their materials, textures, and layouts.\n",
    "- What I changed (prompt/choices):I no longer relied solely on the summaries generated by the AI, but compared the AI's description with my own direct observations.\n",
    "- What I learned about human–AI collaboration:I realized that AI cannot capture the material and sensory aspects of archival objects. Interpreting their specific physical details and background situations requires human observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Week 4 – Project direction (early idea)\n",
    "- Possible object/topic:MS Euing 26 – a 14th century Carmelite missal with decorated initials.\n",
    "- Why it matters (value/context):The manuscript reflects medieval religious culture and visual aesthetics.\n",
    "- What I want the audience to notice/learn:I want to explore how generative AI can recreate or reinterpret illuminated initials and question the notion of authenticity.\n",
    "- Where AI will help (and where it won’t):AI cannot replace the historical context or material authenticity of the original manuscript.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reflection (short)\n",
    "- What AI is good at:Generating stylistic variations quickly.\n",
    "- What AI struggles with:Understanding historical nuance and material authenticity.\n",
    "- What I (human) contributed:Critical judgement, selection, contextual interpretation."
